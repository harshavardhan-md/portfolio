<h3>Where it all started!</h3>
<p>One day in 1st semester when i saw the quiklrn app being so boring and annoying to use, where the basic functionalities for a Students app is not available, I decided to make a better one.</p>
<p>Then I shared this idea with Gurunath Reddy, wherein he was also impressed by the same thought process. </p>
<p>so what next, we waited for the semester to get over, and thought of different ways to monitize the app, and further understood the flaws of quiklrn, such as it has a very high subscription costs to Students, and also there are useless course recommendations all the time, so we wanted to integrate the NPTEL direct access in our website, which will thril the students even more!!</p>

<h3>Wow moment 1!üíñ</h3>
<p>We started figuring out what should be doing in our upcoming project(Theta), then one day Mr. Srinvas suggests Me, Gurunath and Jeevan to create an alternative app for quiklrn, (this was a wow moment for me) because there will be support from the college also to create the project.</p>
<p>Then as time passed we got the oppurtunity of club activities once again, so I started creation of the team Theta, the members are <i>Harshavardhan M(me)</i>, <i>Kishore S R</i>, <i>Gurunath Reddy N A</i>, <i>Derin Girish</i>, <i>Jeevan N</i>, <i>Hitesh P</i>. We submitted the Google forms for the team members and team project idea, but the twist is when our goal from alternative quiklrn changed a real project for students which will be the <h3>One Stop Destination for Students!</h3></p>
